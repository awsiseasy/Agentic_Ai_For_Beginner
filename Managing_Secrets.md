## Securely Managing API Keys with a `.env` File

It is crucial **never to save your secret API key directly in your code files**. We use a special file called **`.env`** (for "environment") to securely store these keys.

### Part A: Generate Your OpenAI API Key

1.  **Create an Account:**
    * Go to the **[OpenAI Platform website](https://platform.openai.com/)** and sign up or log in. You may need to verify your phone number.
2.  **Navigate to API Keys:**
    * Once logged in, click on your profile icon (or the navigation menu) and select **"View API keys"** or go to the **[API Keys page](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)**.
3.  **Create a New Key:**
    * Click the **"+ Create new secret key"** button. 
    * Give your key a descriptive name (e.g., `course-project-key`).
4.  **Copy and Save Immediately:**
    * Click **"Create secret key"**. Your key will be displayed **only once**.
    * **Immediately copy and paste this key** into a temporary, secure document. You will use it in the next step. If you lose it, you must generate a new one.
5.  **Add Billing (Required for Usage):**
    * The key will not work until you have a payment method on file (even for small amounts of usage). Navigate to the **Billing** section to add a payment method and set a usage limit (recommended for safety).

### Part B: Setup the `.env` File

1.  **Create the `.env` File:**
    * Open the main folder for this course repository on your computer.(Or any other folder if you wish to)
    * Inside this main folder, create a **new file** and name it **`.env`** (it must have **no extension** like `.txt`).

2.  **Add Your API Key:**
    * Open the newly created **`.env`** file with a text editor.
    * Store your key using the `KEY=VALUE` format. Paste the key you copied in the previous step:

    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    ```
    * **Crucial:** Do not use quotes around the key value. Save and close the file.

3.  **Accessing the Key in Code:**
    ```python
    import os
    from dotenv import load_dotenv 

    # This command loads the variables from the .env file
    env_path = r'.env full path here'
    load_dotenv(env_path)

    #sample code for above step(commented intentionally - please note, you need to give full path if .env is not present in same folder from where you are running this code, otherwsie no need to give path, code will pick automatically)
    #env_path = r'E:\YTReusable\.env'
    #load_dotenv(env_path)

    # We now try to get the API key
    api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

    if api_key:
        print("Success! Your OpenAI API key was loaded correctly.")
        print(f"Key starts with: {api_key[:5]}...")
    else:
        print("Failure! The key was NOT loaded. Please check your .env file.")
        print("Make sure you are running the notebook from the same directory as the .env file.")
    ```

    * Click the **Run** button (or press `Shift + Enter`) to execute the code.

5.  **Verify the Output:**
    * **Success** will look like this (you should see the first 5 characters of your key):
        ```
        Success! Your OpenAI API key was loaded correctly.
        Key starts with: sk-xx...
        ```
    * **Failure** means you need to re-check the spelling of the file (`.env`), the variable name (`OPENAI_API_KEY`), and that the notebook is running in the correct location.

Congratulations! If you see the **Success** message, your environment is ready for the course!
